we have a local copy of local shell script
we have blog of enormous looking data
tarball is embedded on shell
sh cmake.sh --help 
to do the install 
sh cmake.sh --prefix=(pwd)/cmake-test-install
it prompts for license(y/n)
it asks if it wants the subdirectories(y/n)
now if we open up that directory
dg-open cmake-test-install/
we have the  binaries files
we can retarget the shell scripts to install it globally
now since we don't need that directory
rm -rf cmake-test-install/
this pacakage is not managed by global system package manager 
the packages which are not mananged by the usr/local should go inside usr/local
sudo sh cmake.sh --prefix=/usr/local/ --exclude-subdir
if we se
