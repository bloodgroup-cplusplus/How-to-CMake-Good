create a directory 
cd directory
create the file CMakeLists.txt
Inside the directory create the file build
Build is the file where the cmake scripts are going to run from
cd Build (go inside the build directory)
and type the command
cmake ..
Now go inside the build directory and look at the files present in the cmake
inside the build we will have four files which are the output of the generation
we shall now delete these files to use curses cmake
which is ccmake
text user interface. It is not exactly command line interface
we can now delete these lines and create it using ccmake . It creates an empty terminal but create an empty cache file
also it didn't execute in the system i  am using
there is nothing in the  cache yet
ccmake is good when you want to see the cache but you don't have a gui yet
doing it using a gui on windows is same as doing it from terminal in ubuntu
or you just prefer a text mode user base
