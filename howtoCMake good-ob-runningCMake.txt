create a directory 
cd directory
create the file CMakeLists.txt
Inside the directory create the file build
Build is the file where the cmake scripts are going to run from
cd Build (go inside the build directory)
and type the command
cmake ..
Now go inside the build directory and look at the files present in the cmake
inside the build we will have four files which are the output of the generation
we shall now delete these files to use curses cmake
which is ccmake
text user interface. It is not exactly command line interface
we can now delete these lines and create it using ccmake . It creates an empty terminal but create an empty cache file
also it didn't execute in the system i  am using
there is nothing in the  cache yet
ccmake is good when you want to see the cache but you don't have a gui yet
doing it using a gui on windows is same as doing it from terminal in ubuntu
or you just prefer a text mode user base
the cmake uses clang for c and clang ++ for c++
configuring done and generating done
It doesn't use c++ instead it uses Cxx due to some parsing error
we can run cmake --build( to know what kind of build system is underneath ) followed by the directory where it lives
It ran the build
It launches makes to run the build first
This is good when you are configuring the project and may or maynot know what generators you are using 
cmake --build need not be ran from the same directory you can run it from any directory where you want to build the cmake from
after that it creates an executable called (the filename any filename) and it executes the required code
